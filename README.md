# Electric Vehicle Routing Problem Solver using Ant Colony Optimization

This project is an implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to solve the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem. The algorithm uses a depth-first search approach to build a linked list data structure to represent the routes for electric vehicles.

As traditional arrays are not suitable for this problem, the linked list data structure was used. The algorithm aims to minimize the distance traveled by the electric vehicles, taking into account their battery range limitations. 

The project also includes a front-end interface built using React and Pyscript, which allows users to input their problem data and visualize the solution generated by the algorithm. This portion of the project is under development.
